"Crazy=Genius"

You can set yourself on fire
You can set yourself on fire

She said at night in my dreams
You dance on a tightrope of weird
Oh but when I wake up
You're so normal that you just disappear
You're so straight like commuters
With briefcases towing the line
There's no residue of a torturer
Inside of your eyes

She said you're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson
She said you're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Brian Wilson

And I said
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist
I'm a rocket scientist
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius

You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn, hey a-ay
You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
Hey a-ay

She said, "Darlin', you know
How the wine plays tricks on my tongue
But you don't seem to change
When you stuff all of your feelings with drugs"
Other boys you may have dated
Serrated your heart with a slice
But the cut of your love never hurts
Baby, it's a sweet butter knife

She said you're just like Mike Love
But you wanna be Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson
She said you're just like Mike Love
But you'll never be Dennis Wilson

And I said
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist
I'm a rocket scientist
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius

You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn, hey a-ay
You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
Hey a-ay

You can set yourself on fire
You can set yourself on fire
You can set yourself on fire
You can set yourself on fire

And I said
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius
Then I'm a fucking arsonist
I'm a rocket scientist
Hey a-ay, hey a-ay
If crazy equals genius

You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna burn, burn, burn, hey a-ay
You can set yourself on fire, hey a-ay
But you're never gonna learn, learn, learn
Hey a-ay
